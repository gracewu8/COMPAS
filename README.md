# COMPAS
Redesigning COMPAS for improved ML fairness
The following is project that I worked on for two weeks during Spring of 2020. 
I, along with three classmates, redesigned a rather infamously unfair machine learning algorithm, and wrote a paper to explain why and how we did it. While we collaborated on the approach and design of the actual algorithm, for the writing portions, I was responsible for writing "Introduction" and "Overview of Reductions Approach to Fair Learning Algorithms" (up to pg. 7). 
Enjoy!
